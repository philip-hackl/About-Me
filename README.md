  - Problem Solving with Data

## Projects
Here are a few of my recent data-driven projects that showcase my work:

### [Gutenberg_TextAnalyse](https://github.com/philip-hackl/Gutenberg_TextAnalyse)
**Objective**: Developed an interactive text analysis tool using the Gutenberg dataset. Utilized Python, pandas, and scikit-learn for scraping, processing, and classifying texts.

- Scraped author data and text from Gutenberg Project for analysis.
- Built a Naive Bayes classifier to identify authors based on text content.
- Visualized text analysis results and author probabilities using Streamlit.

### [Air-Quality-Monitoring](https://github.com/philip-hackl/Air-Quality-Monitoring)
**Objective**: Created a dashboard for monitoring and forecasting air quality levels. Leveraged the OpenAQ API, Python, and data visualization libraries.

- Integrated air quality data from OpenAQ and performed data cleaning.
- Developed interactive visualizations to track and analyze air quality trends.
- Implemented predictive modeling for air quality forecasting using linear regression.

### [TicTacToe-Game](https://github.com/philip-hackl/TicTacToe-Game)
**Objective**: Built an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with various difficulty levels to showcase programming skills.

- Developed game logic and a user-friendly interface with Python.
- Included options for playing against both a basic and an advanced AI.
- Provided clear documentation and installation instructions for users.

## Experience
- **Self-Employment**: Ventured into self-employment in E-Commerce and Marketing. Gained valuable experience in digital marketing strategies, online sales, and business development. This experience sharpened my ability to adapt to changing market conditions and understand customer behavior.

## What I'm Looking For
Iâ€™m excited to collaborate on challenging data science projects, especially those that focus on solving real-world problems. I am particularly interested in roles where I can use my skills to create impact through data and learn from others in a dynamic team environment.
